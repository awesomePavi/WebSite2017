					<span>First Project Using WebSockets</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					The purpose of this website was to use real-time web and harness web-sockets in a project which, can reflect a product in the real world.
					<br>
					<br>
					The site prompts for a username to be entered upon loading. The server then sends back any chat logs so the new user can view the history of the chat. Each user is given a unique colour in the chat window. The chat currently only supports text-based chat, but on mobile you are able to include emoticons. The message field is located at the top of the page, to deal with issues with software keyboards on mobile
					<br>
					<br>
					What's Next:
					<ul>
					<li>
					Private Messaging
					</li>
					<li>
					Forcing Unique Usernames
					</li>
					<li>
					Functional Disconnect system
					</li>
					<li>
					Move messaging to bottom of page
					</li>
					</ul>

					This was a server-client implementation. Client-side HTML with Javascript, JQuery and socket.io. Server-side Node.js using express and socket.io; hosted on Microsoft Azure.

					<span style="float: right;"> <b>Created December 2016</b></span>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<span>No suitable products on market</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					The purpose of this website was simply founded, I have been a long time Spotify user and have recently changed services to Apple Music. I searched the web in attempt
					to find a program or service which would allow me to transfer my Specify playlist over to Apple Music. I was unable to find any services that worked which did not
					require IOS, or were free, or used security vulnerabilities which were patched as of ITunes version 12.5.4. To this end I decided it would be in my best interest to
					create my own system.
					<br>
					<br>
					The idea I had was simple, to re-create the ITunes playlist structure I did this by making a simple apple music playlist and exporting it from ITunes. I reverse
					engineered the playlist style and discovered what information I would need to successfully mimic a playlist. I went about building this playlist builder in 4 steps:
					<ul>
						<li> Use the Spotify API to gain access to Spotify playlist and track info</li>
						<li> Build a user interface to select a playlist to convert</li>
						<li> Create a downloadable text file to import into ITunes, through HTML and JavaScript</li>
						<li> Use the ITunes search API, and search songs with the track name and artist provided by Spotify. Assuming the first result returned was correct</li>
					</ul>
					The biggest issue I ran into occurred at the 4th step, for Apple Music requires composer information in the playlist file in-order to successfully include the
					track. This is a piece of Data that I was unable to get from the ITunes API. I then explored different options trying to play with AppleScripts and Apple Music
					API to make a desktop based system but the API for Apple Music in its current capacity is for IOS.
					<br>
					<Br>
					Due to these setbacks the website currently creates Spotify widgets with its Apple Music counterpart, allowing users to find their tracks in Apple Music but until further
					notice the automated transfer of a playlist is unlikely to occur.
					<br>
					<br>
					This was a simple web-based implementation made using, HTML, JavaScript with the Spotify API, ITunes API and the Apple Music Toolbox.

					<hr>
					<span>Yhack 2016</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					The idea behind the program was a test run for a scalable system, building off the idea of how much computing power is wasted by computers idling. As a proof of
					concept a simple data set of meteorite findings across the globe over 100 years was used, where the system would use distributed computing to calculate the likelihood of
					another meteorite hitting a particular location. The system
					that was built used servers provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.1and1.com">1&1</a>, to handle, distribute and merge data. The system would break the
					data up into sector's based on longitude and latitude server side; then when a connection is made it sends a random sector to the connected computer to be
					analyzed (the sector is chosen at random to try and compensate for concurrency issues that may arise from sequential sector analysis). The user's computer would
					receive the data and would process the data with code embedded into the page, once the analysis is completed it is sent back to the server, which flags the sector
					as complete. Then the server merges the analyzed sector to the completed data set, which contains meteor distribution density across the globe. Each time a user
					computer completes another sector everyone which goes to the site can see the output from completed sectors as a world map with different shaded sectors on it.
					<br>
					<br>
					The system had two sides to it a client side and the public side. The client side included an interface to upload data to the server and specify parameters
					for the analysis; the public side consisted of a front facing interface to explain to users what will be happening and where their contribution is going,
					Then a graphic is used to show the progress of the data being crunched by the browser followed by a world map filled with current density information from,
					already crunched data.
					<br>
					<br>
					This was a server/client implementation and was the first time I have worked with a real server using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS to build the entire project.

					<span style="float: left;"> <b>Broadcast system</b></span>
					<span style="float: right;"> <b>Created October 2016</b></span>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<span>McMaster Programming Competition</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					For the competition, we choose to implement an AM/FM Radio broadcasting system to distribute crucial weather information to nearby refugees attempting
					to navigate open waters. The system was built in C++ for we believed that it would require the least amount of resources to operate, as it does not
					require hardware to run a JVM in order to run, but compiles directly into machine code. The system needed to be robust and had to account for
					<ul>
						<li>
							Sudden power outages.
						</li>
						<li>
							Interference from other buoys
						</li>
					</ul>
					The Bouy has access to a AdHoc network linked to all Buoys, and an AM/FM transmitter and Reliever. The program consists of three main parts start-up,
					message handling and error handling.
					<br>
					<br>
					The system we devised would always scan for an AM and FM frequency which is open on start-up, the frequency is chosen at random, to minimize the chances
					of nearby Buoys interfering with each other, the logic for this is that when a frequency is selected the receiver is used to check for interference. In
					an area where there is a dense population of Buoys if signals were selected sequentially from 535 kHz to 1700 kHz (AM), then each starting buoy would
					spend important time checking all the frequencies until it finds an open one, the randomization on startup aims to minimize this issue.
					<br>
					<br>
					Messages to be broadcast are received by the system from the weather module and ocean conditions module, the system would queue up weather
					data and ocean conditions then would alternate its transmissions of the two pieces of data, the queue used for this prioritizes messages by time and dequeue any old information
					if more current data is available. The queue overrides any transmissions if it receives an extreme warning from either the weather module or ocean conditions
					module. The information from the queue is sent to another module to create a human friendly message
					and broadcast it. The module converts the input information into simple speech using a series of filters and bins (implementation not in scope of
					competition), once a message was converted to speech it was broadcast on both the AM and FM bands (The broadcasting of the messages was out of scope of
					the competition).
					<br>
					<br>
					The system will be placed in open water where it must put up with horrendous conditions the system for this reason must be able to notify if it is non-functional
					such that it may be fixed. On startup and periodically on a schedule the system is checked for functionality by broadcasting a signal on it's AM and FM bands and
					then using the receiver to check if the signal received matched the expected output signal. If an issue arises the Buoy uses the AdHoc network to send a message
					across the network to notify a repair is required.
					<br>
					<br>
					This was a server/client implementation and was implemented through C++.

					<span>Term Project</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					The goal for the semester was to advance our documentation, requirements and testing skills to do this the task was to find an existing project and improve it's documentation.
					A decision was made to try and port a game over from Java to the web such that it would not have to be downloaded and ran locally, to try and show that with the power of modern computers
					simple games can be developed for the browser, allowing for ease of access to anyone. Over the course of a semester the requirements and interface spec was created.
					<br>
					<br>
					The implementation occurred in four main phases:
					<ul>
						<li> A simple framework was built to allow the HTML and JavaScript to interact with basic movement included and some simple graphics.
							(<a href="https://jstank.pavipath.com/HTML/Proof-Of-Concept.html" target="_blank">Here</a>)</li>
						<li>
							Core game features were added including tile entities, maps, AI and Difficulty  (<a href="https://jstank.pavipath.com/HTML/JSTanks.html" target="_blank">Here</a>)
						</li>
						<li>
							Homepage, Instructions and bug fixes were added, to a finalized revision  (<a href="https://jstank.pavipath.com/HomePage/homePage.html" target="_blank">Here</a>)
						</li>
						<li>
							An automated testing script was made to test the games features, to save time over conventional manual testing (<a href="https://jstank.pavipath.com/Testing/Test.html" target="_blank">Here</a>)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					This was a Model View Controller implementation and was the port of a simple Java game enhanced and rebuilt in HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.

					<br>
					<br>
					This application's intended purpose is to identify weather stations which are not required and may be relocated. The application does this by first placing all stations in a un-directed edge
					weighted graph, After this the graph is converted into a minimum spanning tree while only keeping edges between stations who's weather data is accurate to one another's within the user's specified
					tolerances. At this point the nodes with the greatest number of edges is removed, which leaves one of three node types. The first are stations which cannot be used to predict other stations, the seconds
					stations used to predict stations, and the third stations predicted. At this point the program then checks if the new layout is still accurate within user tolerances and to do this the program checks
					the layout over two additional years. At this point all data processing has been completed where it is put into a JSON file and is displayed for the user.
					<br>
					<br>
					On the technical side, the program uses a Model View Controller design. The Model being the back-end which is built in ruby and harnesses an SQLite3 database for the data storage and manipulation. The Controller is the server which uses the Sinatra API to effectively connect the Front-end to the Back-end. The View is written in HTML/CSS/Java-Script, and uses an electron wrapper to allow it to act as a standalone application.

					This application was made for android by Mike Hong, Jack Li, Matthew Ngai and myself. This application is targeted to those who are new to the country and do not know much
					about the culture and customs and is designed to make the transition to Canadian life simpler.
					<br>
					Some key features the application offers include:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Push Notification for national Holidays
						</li>
						<li>
							Translations of Commonly used English words into 9 different Languages
						</li>
						<li>
							Currency Exchange Rates
						</li>
						
					</ul>
					<br>
					This was a Batch Sequential Architecture and was implemented through Java and uses the wolfram API

					<span >First Android App</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					This was truly my first android app, I worked on intensively for a few days and then quit on android (until a Hackathon in 2015). I made this application because
					I wanted a game that was simple and fun to play while waiting at the bus stop. The game is straight forward all you must do is dodge the falling blocks. The game itself is
					very inefficient but the idea was simple enough, on first load it would create the images based on the phone’s resolution and size, then the game play would be randomly spaced and placed falling blocks.
					<br>
					The game had features that I believe more applications should have:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Personalized: The app allowed users to select there preferred colour scheme
						</li>
						<li>
							Input: The user could select to use touch input or the phones gyroscope
						</li>
						
					</ul>
					NOTE: This application was made on a Motorola RAZR (not the v3), and is quite buggy on other phones
					<br>
					<br>
					This used the Batch Sequential Architecture and was implemented with Java.

					<br>
					<br>
					This was the first large program that I worked on in a team. Over 3 months we made a custom rendition of the classic game Tetris. We designed and
					implemented a 3D-Render engine from scratch and implemented our rendition on the classic game Tetris.
					<br>
					The features that set this game apart from the rest were:
					<ul>
						<li>
							New Blocks: 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, miniature L, Bomb (Blew up blocks)
						</li>
						<li>
							Screen Rotation: Rotating the game and physics 90, 180 and 270 degrees randomly
						</li>
						<li>
							Custom Game Mode: You can include or exclude any features
						</li>
						<li>
							A variety of 3D-Depths
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					This used the Model View Controller Architecture and was implemented with Java.

					<span >Grade 9 - Intro to Programming</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					This was the first program that I made with graphics. In high school I was not able to appreciate the text based programs we were working on
					in class because it seemed too simple. During class I would typically finish my work early and use the reference guide to find new things. I
					taught myself arrays, graphics, and loops. Than made this snake game to show my work, this very high level language is what made me finally decide to become a Software Engineer.
					<br>
					<br>
					This used the Batch Sequential and was implemented with Turing.
